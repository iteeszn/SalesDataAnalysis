### EDA
####  For Data Exploration, the following reports and visualizations have been created for analysis:
```
- Revenue
- COGS
- Profit
- Quantity
- Sales Channel Analysis
- Sales Trend
- Slicers by Quarter and Channel
- Top 5 Sales Team, Profitable State and Product Categories
- Region Sales
  ```


### Analysis and Recommendations
1. The Sales Trend shows a fluctuating pattern from January to May, with a notable dip in February and April. However, sales peaked in May at $9.18M.
•  	Investigate the causes behind the sales dips in February and April to identify potential operational or seasonal factors. Implement strategies to maintain consistent sales, such as promotions or marketing efforts during low-performing months.
2. The Top-5 Profitable Products chart highlights that Clocks ($0.314K) and Vases ($0.303K) are the highest profit-generating products, while Phones ($0.289K) ranked lower.
•	  Focus on promoting high-margin products like Clocks and Vases. For lower-margin products such as Phones, analyze whether adjusting pricing or optimizing production costs could boost profitability.
3. The Sales Channel Analysis shows that the In-Store channel generates the highest revenue ($11.14M) and profit ($3.18M), while Wholesale and Distributor channels contribute the lowest profit margins despite strong revenue.
     Prioritize investment in the In-Store channel as it has the highest profitability. For channels like Wholesale and Distributor, explore ways to reduce costs or increase sales to improve their profit margins.
4. The % Revenue by Region pie chart reveals that the Midwest region contributes the largest share of revenue (30%), followed by the South (24%).
  •	Leverage the strong performance in the Midwest by allocating more resources and marketing efforts to maintain this lead. For underperforming regions, analyze local factors and customer behaviors to identify potential growth opportunities.
5. The Top 5 Sales Team chart indicates that Nicholas Cunningham generated the highest sales ($1.856M), while Carl Nguyen generated the lowest among the top 5 teams ($1.753M).
  •	Recognize and reward high-performing sales teams like Nicholas Cunningham’s. Identify strategies and best practices they use and implement them across other teams to improve overall performance.

### Dataset Limitations
Lack of Qualitative Insights: The analysis focuses on quantitative data without considering qualitative factors, such as customer feedback and market trends, which may limit the understanding of underlying issues and opportunities for improvement.
